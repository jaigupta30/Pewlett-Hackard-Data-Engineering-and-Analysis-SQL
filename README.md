# Pewlett Hackard SQL Project
This repository contains the necessary files to complete the SQL project for Pewlett Hackard. The project involves working with the provided CSV files in the 'data' folder and executing the SQL scripts in the 'Schemas' folder to create tables and perform various data analysis tasks. The specific goals of the project are listed below:

List of Employee Information: Retrieve the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary for each employee.

Additionally, the 'ERD' folder contains an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) titled SQL_Challenge_ERD.PNG. This diagram visually represents the interconnections between all the tables in the relational database.
